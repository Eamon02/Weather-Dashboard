# Weather Dashboard

A weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS using a thirdparty weather API. A user can search for the weather forecast of any city with dynamically updating themes based on current weather conditions. The five most recent cities are saved to local storage and displayed within a history bar. 

## User Story
